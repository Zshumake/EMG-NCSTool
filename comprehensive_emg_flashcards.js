An early and accurate diagnosis allows individuals to recover quickly. treatment generally consists of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or immunosuppressive therapy with cyclophosphamide. Improvement in muscle strength usually begins within three to six weeks after treatment is started. Most who receive treatment early experience little, if any, disability.

Following are the details for release and synthesis of norepinephrine: - The amino acid tyrosine is transported into the sympathetic nerve axon. - Tyrosine is converted to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) by tyrosine hydroxylase. - DOPA is converted to dopamine by DOPA decarboxylase. - Dopamine is transported into vesicles then converted to norepinephrine by dopamine b-hydroxylase. - An AP traveling down the axon depolarizes the membrane and causes calcium to enter the axon. - Increased intracellular calcium causes the vesicles to migrate to the axonal membrane and fuse with the membrane, which permits the norepinephrine to diffuse out of the vesicle into the extracellular space. - The norepinephrine binds to the postjunctional receptor and stimulates the effector organ response.",
