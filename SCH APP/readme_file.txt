1. **Download the files**:
   - `pmr_scheduler.py` (main application)
   - `requirements.txt` (dependencies)
   - `README.md` (this file)

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run pmr_scheduler.py
   ```

4. **Open in browser**:
   The application will automatically open in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Usage

### Basic Schedule Generation

1. **Click "Generate"** in the sidebar to create a new schedule
2. **Monitor progress** through the real-time statistics and log
3. **Review results** in the calendar view and quota tracking

### Calendar Navigation

- Use the **month buttons** (July, August, September) to switch between months
- Each day shows assigned residents with shift type abbreviations:
  - **C** = Call
  - **M** = Moonlight  
  - **W** = Weekend

### Chief Override System

1. **Expand the "Apply Manual Override" section**
2. **Select date, resident, and shift type**
3. **Apply override** to manually assign shifts when needed
4. **Check availability** to see why residents might be unavailable

### Export Options

- **JSON Export**: Complete schedule data with metadata
- **CSV Export**: Tabular format for spreadsheet analysis
- **HTML Export**: Print-ready calendar format

## Scheduling Rules

### Hard Rules (Cannot be violated)

- **PGY-2 Restrictions**: No call before July 15, no moonlight before August 1
- **Weekend Structure**: PGY-3s cover first two weekends, PGY-2s with PGY-4 mentors for first weekend
- **Shift Conflicts**: No same-day call + moonlight, no consecutive day assignments (except Fri→Sat weekends)
- **Weekly Limits**: Maximum 2 shifts per week per resident
- **Friday Call**: Only PGY-3s can take Friday call shifts
- **Time-off Respect**: All resident time-off requests are honored
- **Quota Enforcement**: Annual quotas distributed appropriately across quarters

### Quota Targets (Q3 2025)

| PGY Level | Call Shifts | Moonlight Shifts | Weekend Shifts |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| PGY-2     | 10          | 5                | 2              |
| PGY-3     | 8           | 7                | 1              |
| PGY-4     | 1           | 7                | 0              |

## Resident Data

The system includes 13 residents with their complete:
- **Time-off requests** (vacation days, conferences, etc.)
- **Specific shift requests** (preferred call dates)
- **PGY level and quota targets**
- **Automatic display name handling** (e.g., "Natalie B" vs "Natalie C")

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Python/Streamlit** web application
- **Sequential processing** algorithm
- **Constraint satisfaction** approach
- **Real-time validation** and logging

### Data Structures
- **Resident class**: Complete resident information and tracking
- **Shift class**: Individual shift assignments with metadata
- **Schedule dictionary**: Date-indexed shift storage
- **Statistics tracking**: Performance metrics and rule compliance

### Key Algorithms
1. **Eligibility filtering**: Multi-stage rule checking for each assignment
2. **Quota balancing**: Debt-based selection prioritizing residents behind target
3. **Weekend cycling**: Fair rotation with gap tracking for moonlight assignments
4. **Conflict resolution**: Automatic handling of competing requests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No eligible residents" errors**:
- Check PGY-2 blackout periods (July 1-14 for call, July 1-31 for moonlight)
- Verify time-off requests aren't too restrictive
- Use override system for emergency assignments

**Quota imbalances**:
- Review the quota tracking table for residents falling behind
- Consider manual overrides to redistribute workload
- Check for clustering of time-off requests

**Weekend coverage gaps**:
- Ensure sufficient PGY-3s available for first two weekends
- Verify PGY-2/PGY-4 availability for split weekends
- Check weekend issues tab for detailed problems

### Performance Tips

- **Reset and regenerate** if major changes are needed
- **Use overrides sparingly** to maintain rule compliance
- **Export regularly** to save schedule iterations
- **Monitor the log** for early detection of issues
